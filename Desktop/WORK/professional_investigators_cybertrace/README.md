     --type "comprehensive" \
     --target "target-system.com"
   ```

4. **Collect evidence**:
   ```bash
   # File evidence
   ./start_investigation_system.sh collect-evidence \
     --case-id "your-case-id" \
     --type "file" \
     --source "/path/to/evidence/file.txt"
   
   # System information
   ./start_investigation_system.sh collect-evidence \
     --case-id "your-case-id" \
     --type "system_info" \
     --source "localhost"
   ```

5. **Generate investigation reports**:
   ```bash
   ./start_investigation_system.sh generate-report \
     --case-id "your-case-id" \
     --type "comprehensive" \
     --format "html"
   ```

   chmod 755 main.py
   chmod 600 config/*.yaml
   ```

2. **Python module not found**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Network connectivity issues**:
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify DNS resolution
   - Test network connectivity
