More details about the claim are
This application challenges the validity of a Notice to Vacate dated 11 July 2025 issued by Areal Property Hawthorn. The notice constitutes retaliatory eviction under Section 91ZZE of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (Vic), issued in direct response to legitimate maintenance complaints regarding water damage in the bedroom wall reported on 16 April 2025.

Timeline evidence shows the landlord's pattern of hostility following our VCAT application RT252398 (lodged 24 June 2025, withdrawn 27 June 2025), with the retaliatory notice issued just 14 days after case withdrawal.

We seek orders declaring the notice invalid and preventing eviction based on retaliatory conduct.

Application under Residential Tenancies Act 1997 challenging validity of notice to vacate - residential Section 91ZZS

VCAT finds:
1. The applicants have filed an application under section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 challenging the validity of a notice to vacate.

2. The notice to vacate in question was given to the renter under section 91ZL of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997.

3. Section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 specifies that a renter may apply to challenge the validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZX , 91ZY, 91ZZ, 91ZZA, 91ZZB or 91ZZC. It does not allow a renter to challenge the validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZL.

4. Pursuant to section 75 of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998, the Tribunal has formed the view on the material before it, that the application is misconceived.

5. The renters cannot preemptively challenge the notice to vacate. However, the renters can still challenge the validity of the notice to vacate under section 91ZZI of the Act if the residential rental provider applies for a possession order on the basis of the 91ZL notice to vacate issued on 11 July 2025.

6. The Tribunal notes that if the parties can agree on an arrangement for the renters to move out for about 14 days, the repairs could be completed and the renters could return to the premises.

VCAT orders:
1. The application is struck out with a right to apply for reinstatement.

Note: If the applicants apply for reinstatement they must provide details of why the strike out order is opposed, including a response to the findings made by the Tribunal above.

Select the issue(s) with the property:

Flooding or serious flood damage:
Water damage discovered on 16 April 2025 in bedroom above bed area. Wall bulge appeared and spread rapidly from ceiling to floor within 24 hours. Source identified as hot water system leak in ceiling on 28 April 2025. Bedroom has been unusable for over 2 months due to persistent moisture, mold growth, structural damage, and safety concerns. Complete remediation including wall restoration and carpet replacement has not been completed.

Property does not meet minimum standards:
Bedroom fails to meet minimum standards under Residential Tenancies Act due to: (1) Unusable sleeping area for 2+ months, (2) Persistent moisture and mold creating health hazards, (3) Structural damage compromising safety, (4) Inadequate ventilation causing ongoing damp conditions. Property manager has failed to restore habitability within reasonable timeframe despite multiple requests.

Water services (burst):
Hot water system leak in ceiling identified on 28 April 2025 by plumber. Initial leak caused extensive water damage to bedroom wall and flooring. While source leak reportedly fixed, internal damage including wall restoration, mold remediation, and carpet replacement remains incomplete. Water damage continues to impact habitability of bedroom.

Unsafe or insecure fault or damage in the property: including pests, mould or damp caused by or related to the building structure:
Ongoing mold growth and damp conditions in bedroom creating health hazards. Structural wall damage from water ingress compromises safety. Persistent musty odors and poor air quality documented in medical certificate from Era Health dated 23 June 2025. Bedroom remains uninhabitable due to safety and health concerns from unresolved water damage.

Steps taken to resolve the issue:
Water damage was first reported on 16 April 2025. Property management was transferred from Hilary Ho to Sylvia Hao on the same day without addressing the urgent issue. Multiple follow-up emails were sent on 20 April, 23 April, and throughout May 2025. A plumber identified the source as a hot water system leak on 28 April 2025, but complete repairs including wall restoration, mold remediation, and carpet replacement have not been completed. The bedroom remains unusable for over 2 months. Repairs are now scheduled for 24 June 2025 at 8:30 AM with no alternative accommodation provided.

Have you raised the issue(s) in writing with your rental provider or real estate agent:
Yes

How do you want this dispute to be resolved:
1. Immediate provision of alternative accommodation during repair period
2. Compensation for rent paid while bedroom was unusable (approximately $1,400-1,500 per month for 2+ months)
3. Complete restoration of property to habitable condition
4. Protection orders preventing retaliation
5. Assurance that all future repairs will be completed within reasonable timeframes
6. Compensation for stress, inconvenience, and health impacts as documented by medical certificate

I want VCAT to redirect my rent payments into a Rent Special Account until repairs are completed

NOTICE TO VACATE TO RENTER OF RENTED PREMISES
INFORMATION FOR RENTERS

Residential Tenancies Act 1997
Section 91ZZO(a)
(Regulation 37)

1. This is a notice to vacate. It tells you that the residential rental provider (rental provider) wants you to move out by a certain date. You can find details of this date in clause 10 "Termination date" below.

2. Challenging this notice - You may be able to challenge this Notice at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). Reasons to challenge a notice include:
• you believe you were given this notice due to unlawful discrimination or because you tried to exercise your rights as a renter; or
• you believe it was not given to you properly; or
• you disagree with the reason given or the information in the form is incorrect or incomplete; or
• you have experienced family or personal violence and this caused the behavior listed in the notice to vacate. In this case, you should apply to VCAT within 30 days after the notice has been given.

Specific timeframes may apply to certain reasons to challenge a notice. You may also challenge the validity of the notice if the rental provider applies to VCAT for a possession order.

You should seek advice if you are considering challenging a notice to vacate.

3. Unpaid Rent
If you received a notice because you have not paid your rent -
• If you pay all of the unpaid rent on or before the termination date in the notice, this notice has no effect.
• However, this does not apply if you have been given four earlier notices to vacate for rent arrears within a twelve-month period that starts either on the date your agreement commenced or the anniversary of that date.
• You can find out more about this type of notice to vacate on the Consumer Affairs Victoria website.

4. Possession orders and warrants - Rental providers must give you the appropriate notice to vacate before they apply to VCAT for a possession order.

If you do not vacate on the date stated in the notice, the rental provider may apply to VCAT asking for an order requiring you to leave (a possession order). VCAT will notify you of a hearing date that you can attend. You are encouraged to attend the hearing.

At the hearing, VCAT decides whether the rental provider was entitled to give you a notice to vacate. VCAT will make a possession order if it is satisfied that it is reasonable and proportionate to do so. VCAT may consider whether the notice to vacate was given in response to the act of a person who has subjected you to family or personal violence. It may also consider whether you can comply with a payment plan for any rental arrears, if applicable.

VCAT will decide if you must leave the property and on what date that should occur. You may ask for more time in the property if you will be in hardship. Rental providers cannot personally use force to remove you if you refuse to leave the property. Only Victoria Police can carry out a forcible eviction, and only when they are acting on a VCAT order (a warrant for possession).

5. Ending the residential rental agreement earlier - In some cases, you may be able to end the residential rental agreement (rental agreement) earlier than the termination date in the notice to vacate, if the notice is given for one of the following reasons:

Repairs or renovations; demolition; change of use of premises; occupation by the rental provider or their family; the premises are to be sold; the premises are required for a public purpose; the renter no longer meets the eligibility criteria; or in the case of a fixed term rental agreement, to specify a termination date that is on or after the date of the end of the initial fixed term of the agreement.

To notify the rental provider, use a Notice of intention to vacate form and provide at least 14 days notice.

6. Seeking advice - If you think you have grounds to challenge a notice to vacate at VCAT you should seek advice immediately by contacting one of the community legal organisations listed on the Consumer Affairs Victoria website. For further information visit the renting section of the Consumer Affairs Victoria website at consumer.vic.gov.au/renting or call 1300 558 181.

The minimum number of days' notice required under the Act is 0.

I request that you vacate on or before the following termination date: 14 July 2025

Note: If you want to challenge this notice you should seek legal advice as soon as possible.

11. Reason for notice
• The rental provider must select the relevant reason, section number and the minimum notice required under the act.
• The rental provider must also explain why the notice has been given. It is not enough to quote just from the Act or from the reasons on the information sheet; this must be accompanied by specific details.
• VCAT may find a notice to vacate invalid where it does not provide enough details or is not accompanied by the required documentary evidence.

I am giving you this notice for the following reason:

Section 91ZL Unsafe premises

The premises are unfit for human habitation or have been destroyed totally, or to such an extent as to be rendered unsafe.

A roof leak from common property caused water to enter the bedroom, resulting in swollen plaster, bubbling paint, and visible mould. On 23 May 2025, contractor FIXD Trade Group inspected and confirmed the room is unsafe. Urgent mould remediation is required, including sealing the room, chemical treatment, and drying using industrial equipment. Drying is expected to take 7 days, followed by reinstatement of plaster and painting, with the full process taking up to 14 days.

The property will be unsafe and unsuitable to occupy during this time due to noise, equipment use, and health risks. Despite multiple written requests, the renter has refused access, preventing critical repairs.

This Notice to Vacate is issued to allow urgent works and restore the property to a habitable standard. The renter is required to vacate by 14 July 2025.

In many cases this notice must be accompanied by documentary evidence. For information on documentary evidence go to www.consumer.vic.gov.au/ntv

Is documentary evidence attached? Yes

Please provide details of the evidence attached:
Message Thread Franklin Street (PDF)

This includes a detailed email thread between the managing agent, contractor (FIXD Trade Group), and the Owners Corporation. It provides:
Confirmation of mould presence and safety concerns
Scope of remediation works (drying, sealing, chemical treatment)
Estimated timeline for drying (7 days) plus reinstatement
Statement that the property is unsafe and inaccessible during the works
Contractor recommendation for the tenant to vacate

12. Delivery of this notice
• The notice period begins the day after the renter is estimated to receive this notice.
• If sending by post, the rental provider must allow for the delivery time in calculating the proposed termination date.
• If sending by registered post, the rental provider should keep evidence of the mail delivery method used to send this notice.

This notice was sent on 11 July 2025

Dear Chawakorn Kamnuansil and Podjana Tienmon,

I hope you are both well.

As previously communicated, we issued a Notice to Vacate requiring the return of keys by 14 July 2025. As the keys have not been returned and possession of the property has not been granted, we have now submitted a VCAT application (Ref: R202518589/00) to request possession of the premises, in accordance with the owner's instructions.

Please find attached the VCAT application form and a copy of the Notice to Vacate for your reference.

Should you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter, feel free to contact me.

Kind regards,

Hi Matthew,

We would like to bring to your attention that over the past few weeks, we have made every reasonable effort to coordinate with the Owners Corporation (OC) and the appointed contractor, FIXD, to facilitate essential repair works at the property. This is now our second attempt to proceed with the repairs. To clarify, all relevant parties – including the OC, FIXD, our agency as the managing agent, and the rental provider are fully committed to commencing and completing the necessary repairs as promptly as possible.

We are more than willing to provide any further information the renter may reasonably request to facilitate cooperation. However, we respectfully request that VCAT take into account that we are NOT the party impeding progress.

Hi Chawakorn,

Please refer to below response in blue, as I have communicated with FIXD prior to this email.

I will get the remaining requested details from FIXD, but I can't guarantee that they will reply within 24 hours.

Given that coordinating this repair requires the involvement of multiple parties and significant resources, your cooperation is not only appreciated but essential to ensure the work can proceed without further delay.

Thank you.

Dear Johnson,

Your three Section-86 notices, lodged by registered post on 27 June 2025, seek entry at 08:00 AM on 7, 8 and 9 July—only **12 days'** lead time—and leave the "Details attached" box unchecked. Entry therefore remains conditional.

SEND WITHIN 24 HOURS
1. Contractor legal name, licence number & 24-hour mobile – Pending FIXD's reply
2. Day-by-day work scope (rooms, tasks, time estimates) for the full 7-day schedule The first stage of the repair involves reducing the moisture levels in the affected bedroom, as outlined in the Notice of Entry. During this drying process, the contractor will require daily access to the room in order to monitor and record moisture readings. At this stage, they are unable to provide specific time estimates for this phase, as the duration will depend on how quickly acceptable moisture levels are reached. Once the area has dried sufficiently, they will proceed with the necessary repair work. Please note that because the contractor has not yet assessed the current site conditions in full, they are unable to provide a definitive timeline or scope for the repairs at this time.
3. Risk statement – water / power interruptions & noise levels - Pending FIXD's reply
4. Public-liability / PI insurance certificate - Pending FIXD's reply
5. "Tax invoice.pdf" **and** the alleged "tenant-confirmation" screenshot FIXD has been engaged by the Owners Corporation, as the source of the leak originates from a common area. The OC will cover the cost of the repairs once the work is completed. At this stage, FIXD is unable to provide a quote, as they have not yet been able to assess the current site conditions in detail. Could you please clarify what you mean by a "tenant-confirmation screenshot"?
6. Daily-rate schedule for drying equipment **plus** written assurance that no "no-access" surcharge will be levied without a Tribunal order As previously mentioned, FIXD is the contractor appointed by the Owners Corporation (OC), and the OC will be covering the cost of the scheduled works. Could you please clarify the relevance of the "daily-rate schedule for drying equipment"? There will be no additional charges incurred, provided FIXD is granted access in accordance with the Notice of Entry and there are no delays caused by restricted access or obstruction to the repair process.

_No bundle → No entry → Call-out fee remains fictional._

**Provisional window (if items 1-6 arrive):** **Wed 9 Jul 2025, 15 : 30 – 19 : 00 AEST**

**Retaliatory warning** Your 27 Jun 15 : 09 email ("…deduct from your bond…") breaches s 264 RTA. Any repeat—or any attempt to impose daily drying fees without prior disclosure—will trigger my application for penalty units and costs.

**Non-confirmation notice** Until items 1-6 are supplied, this email does **not** constitute consent.

Key verbatim excerpts for easy reference:
• *Exh A – 16 Jun 04 : 37 (tenant)* "any update … I'll reply before 12 : 00 …"
• *Exh B – 16 Jun 11 : 52 (agent)* "Thanks so much … **for confirming** …"
• *Exh C – 23 Jun 14 : 35 (agent)* "remediation work … 24 Jun 08 : 30 … provide access …"
• *Exh D – 27 Jun 15 : 09 (agent)* "**we will deduct it from your bond**."

Your own notices concede the job "might be extended subject to the length of the drying process" yet provide no timeline or cost caps. Please resolve that conflict by supplying items 1-6 above.
