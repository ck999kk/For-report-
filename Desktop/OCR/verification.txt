1.2 I have personal knowledge of the facts and matters deposed to in this affidavit.

### 2. EMAIL EXTRACTION PROCESS
2.1 On 16 August 2025, I extracted email communications from an mbox format file containing correspondence relevant to the residential tenancy dispute.

2.2 The extraction was performed using Python email libraries to convert mbox format to JSON and text formats.

2.3 I preserved all original metadata including Message-IDs, timestamps, sender/recipient information, and email headers.

2.4 The extraction process maintained the integrity of the original email content without alteration.

3.2 Each file contains a complete and accurate representation of the email communications extracted from the source mbox file.

3.3 No emails were deleted, modified, or excluded from the extraction process.

### 4. PDF COMPILATION
4.1 I compiled PDF attachments from the email correspondence into a single document titled "ATTACHMENT_PDF_COMBINE.pdf".

4.2 I created an index and bookmark file "ATTACHMENT_PDF_COMBINE_BOOKMARKS.md" containing OCR text extraction from all 68 pages.

4.3 The PDF compilation maintains the original formatting and content of all source documents.

### 5. TECHNICAL VERIFICATION
5.1 File integrity hashes were generated at time of creation:

5.2 These hash values can be used to verify the files have not been altered since creation.

### 6. SOURCE SYSTEM ACCESS

7.2 The deduplication process is documented in DEDUPLICATION_REPORT.txt showing 47 unique files retained and 8 duplicates removed.

7.3 No unique email content was removed during the deduplication process.

### 8. DECLARATION

⚠️ **Source System Verification** - No certification from original email system  
⚠️ **Expert Witness** - May need technical expert if authenticity challenged

## INTEGRITY MONITORING

### Change Detection Protocol
1. **Baseline Established:** 16 August 2025 hashes serve as integrity baseline
2. **Verification Frequency:** Before each transfer or submission
3. **Alert Conditions:** Any hash mismatch indicates file modification
4. **Response Procedure:** Investigate cause and document any changes

### Expected Hash Stability
These files should maintain identical hash values throughout the legal process unless:
- Authorized modifications are made with proper documentation
- Files are reformatted for specific submission requirements
- Technical corrections are applied with chain of custody documentation

### Tamper Evidence
Any change to file content will result in completely different SHA256 hash values, providing cryptographic evidence of:
- Unauthorized modifications
- File corruption
- System integrity issues
- Transfer errors

---

## LEGAL COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Evidence Act 2008 (Victoria) Requirements
- **Section 48:** Hash verification supports document content proof
- **Authentication:** Cryptographic hashes provide technical authentication
- **Integrity:** Demonstrates files unchanged since creation
- **Chain of Custody:** Hash verification at each custody transfer

### VCAT Submission Standards
- **Technical Integrity:** Files verified for corruption-free submission
- **Size Compliance:** Total package (12.6MB) well under VCAT limits
- **Format Verification:** All files in acceptable formats
- **Accessibility:** Hash verification ensures file readability

### Digital Forensics Standards
- **NIST Guidelines:** Hash verification follows NIST SP 800-86 recommendations
- **ISO 27037:** Aligns with international digital evidence handling standards
- **Chain of Custody:** Cryptographic verification supports custody integrity
- **Expert Testimony:** Hash values provide technical foundation for expert evidence

---
