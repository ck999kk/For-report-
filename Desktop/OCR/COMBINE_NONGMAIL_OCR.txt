Select the issue(s) with the property:
Flooding or serious flood damage:
Water damage discovered on 16 April 2025 in bedroom above bed area. Wall bulge appeared and spread rapidly from ceiling to floor within 24 hours. Source identified as hot water system leak in ceiling on 28 April 2025. Bedroom has been unusable for over 2 months due to persistent moisture, mold growth, structural damage, and safety concerns. Complete remediation including wall restoration and carpet replacement has not been completed.

Property Propdoes not meet?minimum standards:
Bedroom fails to meet minimum standards under Residential Tenancies Act due to: (1) Unusable sleeping area for 2+ months, (2) Persistent moisture and mold creating health hazards, (3) Structural damage compromising safety, (4) Inadequate ventilation causing ongoing damp conditions. Property manager has failed to restore habitability within reasonable timeframe despite multiple requests.

Water services (burst):
Hot water system leak in ceiling identified on 28 April 2025 by plumber. Initial leak caused extensive water damage to bedroom wall and flooring. While source leak reportedly fixed, internal damage including wall restoration, mold remediation, and carpet replacement remains incomplete. Water damage continues to impact habitability of bedroom.

Unsafe or insecure fault or damage in the property: including?pests, mould or damp?caused by or related to the building structure:
Ongoing mold growth and damp conditions in bedroom creating health hazards. Structural wall damage from water ingress compromises safety. Persistent musty odors and poor air quality documented in medical certificate from Era Health dated 23 June 2025. Bedroom remains uninhabitable due to safety and health concerns from unresolved water damage.

Steps taken to resolve the issue: 
Water damage was first reported on 16 April 2025. Property management was transferred from Hilary Ho to Sylvia Hao on the same day without addressing the urgent issue. Multiple follow-up emails were sent on 20 April, 23 April, and throughout May 2025. A plumber identified the source as a hot water system leak on 28 April 2025, but complete repairs including wall restoration, mold remediation, and carpet replacement have not been completed. The bedroom remains unusable for over 2 months. Repairs are now scheduled for 24 June 2025 at 8:30 AM with no alternative accommodation provided.

Have you raised the issue(s) in writing with your rental provider or real estate agent:
Yes 
 
How do you want this dispute to be resolved:
1. Immediate provision of alternative accommodation during repair period
2. Compensation for rent paid while bedroom was unusable (approximately $1,400-1,500 per month for 2+ months)
3. Complete restoration of property to habitable condition
4. Protection orders preventing retaliation
5. Assurance that all future repairs will be completed within reasonable timeframes
6. Compensation for stress, inconvenience, and health impacts as documented by medical certificate

I want VCAT to redirect my rent payments into a Rent Special Account until repairs are completed

Subject: Without Prejudice - Formal Demand for Remedial Action and Rent Compensation

Dear Sylvia,

Without prejudice, I write to you in good faith with the intent to resolve this matter amicably, without escalation to proceedings under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC).

As previously notified in writing on multiple occasions, the severe water damage affecting the bedroom in Unit 1803 has rendered that part of the premises functionally unusable. This has substantially interfered with my ability to enjoy the premises peacefully, as protected under s.67 of the Act.

Accordingly, I make the following formal demand to be addressed without further delay:

1. Rectification Works:
A binding written commitment specifying commencement and completion dates for all necessary repairs, including plaster replacement, carpet remediation, and mould treatment where applicable.

2. Rent Compensation (30%):
I request a rent reduction of 30% commencing from 15 April 2025 until the affected bedroom is fully restored and safe for normal use. This percentage is based on the fact that 1 out of 2 bedrooms (i.e. 50% of the private quarters) has been rendered unusable for essential residential functions due to water damage, odour, and potential health hazards from prolonged dampness.

In line with sections 207(1)(c) and 210 of the Act, the Tribunal has the discretion to order rent reduction where part of the premises is unfit for occupation, regardless of whether the rental provider is at fault. The 30% requested is proportional, reasonable, and evidence-based.

3. Tenant Liability:
A written confirmation that I bear no responsibility for any of the costs associated with rectification works, as the damage has originated from common building infrastructure, which falls under the responsibility of the Owners Corporation.

If all of the above items are confirmed in writing within five (5) business days, I am prepared to consider the matter fully resolved and will continue the tenancy in good faith.

Failing this, I reserve my right to initiate proceedings before VCAT under section 452 of the Act, seeking urgent repairs and compensation for loss of amenity and breach of statutory duties.

All future correspondence regarding this matter must be in writing.

Sincerely,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil 

Tenant Statement of Verbal Communications and Delayed Repairs

I, Chawakorn Kamnuansil, tenant of Unit 1803 at 243 Franklin Street, Melbourne VIC, provide this statement in relation to a phone call I received from the managing agent (Areal Property) around 2-3 June 2025, and the ongoing failure to rectify serious water damage in my unit.

1. During the call, I was informed that a dehumidifier would be installed in the damaged bedroom, and that it would emit continuous noise and operate 24/7. I was advised that it would be better for me and my roommate to temporarily vacate the property.

2. I was asked whether I could stay with nearby friends or relatives. I replied that I could not and would not, because it is not my responsibility to resolve a crisis created by agency inaction. I also noted that the agency had not provided any alternative accommodation options.

3. The agency stated that if I were to seek temporary accommodation, it would only be reimbursed if the cost did not exceed the current rent ($2,825/month). This is impractical-my roommate and I are not in a personal relationship and cannot share a single room. Finding two separate rooms for a short-term stay in Melbourne under $700/week is not realistic.

4. I acknowledged that the landlord had offered temporary accommodation at a residence in Mount Waverley, but I declined. My life and work are based in the city, and relocation would severely impact my routine. I asked if other options existed. The agent replied that the "final option" would be for me to terminate the lease early.

5. I made it clear that I would not terminate the lease. I have taken exceptional care of the property. I clean regularly, report issues promptly, and had no part in causing this damage. The water intrusion was first reported in mid-April. Had repairs been actioned swiftly, the situation would not have escalated to the current level.

6. I lived through the consequences-damp smells, wall stains, an unusable bedroom-without any real assistance. I feared undertaking repairs myself in case I became liable. I used air purifiers and candles daily just to remain inside the apartment.

7. Two months later, no significant progress has been made. I am now being pressured with unsuitable options. I respectfully ask why no urgency was shown when I first raised this matter. Had action been taken earlier, extensive damage could have been avoided.

This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and made in good faith.

Signed, 
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Subject: Urgent: Water Damage on Bedroom Wall (Unit 1803)
From: Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com>
Date: 16/4/68, 04:05
To: hilary.ho@areal.com.au

Dear Hilary,

I'm contacting you regarding an urgent issue in my unit (1803, 243 Franklin Street). This evening , I noticed a water leak forming on the wall above my bed. Within a single day, it spread rapidly — now forming a long vertical swelling nearly from ceiling to floor.

I live on the top floor, so this may indicate a ceiling or roof issue. I'm concerned it could worsen quickly if not addressed.

Please arrange for a maintenance inspection as soon as possible. I've attached photos for reference. Let me know if I need to do anything in the meantime.

Also, I'd appreciate an update on the status of the bed repair I previously reported.

Thanks,
Chawakorn

Subject: Second Follow-up: Urgent Water Damage Escalation – Immediate Action Required (Unit 1803)
From: Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com>
Date: 23/4/68, 20:53
To: sylvia.hao@areal.com.au

Dear Sylvia,

I hope you are doing well.

I'm writing again to follow up on the urgent water leakage issue in my unit (1803, 243 Franklin Street), which I first reported prior to the Easter holiday.

At the time, I was advised that this would be treated as a priority and was also provided with a contact list for emergency tradespeople. In accordance with that advice, I reached out to Flood Response as listed. Unfortunately, they replied stating that they were closed on Easter Monday and unable to attend. I've attached a screenshot of their message for reference.

Since then, I have not received any updates or confirmation regarding the next steps, even though the holiday period has now ended. Meanwhile, the situation has continued to worsen.

Attached are the most recent photos taken today, clearly showing the ceiling stains spreading further, severe wall swelling, and visible water marks continuing to develop. More critically, as the flooring in my room is carpeted, water has now begun to soak into the carpet, creating both dampness and a persistent musty odour.

This is no longer just a structural concern — it now directly affects my personal living conditions and health. The continued moisture increases the risk of mould developing beneath the carpet, which could pose serious health risks and result in more extensive damage if not addressed immediately.

I've followed every step requested and have been as patient as possible. However, at this stage, I must insist on urgent action. I trust that I will not be held responsible for any resulting damages, especially given that I have reported the issue early and complied with all procedures.

Please confirm when a professional will attend the property to inspect and begin repairs. I'd truly appreciate your prompt attention and resolution to this matter.

Also, if possible, could you please update my contact details to ensure you're using my current number: 0449 962 645.

For the previous issue regarding the bed, I suspect there may have been an attempt to reach me on an outdated number.

Kind regards,
Chawakorn Kamnuansil

Hi Chawakorn,

I just wanted to give you a quick update. The Strata's plumber attended to the hot water leak last Wednesday and has addressed the issue. I'll be confirming with the building management shortly if there's any further action needed.

Could you please let me know if you've noticed any further water ingress or any issues since the plumber's visit?

Thanks for your help.

From: Chawakorn Kamnuansil <ck.chawakorn@gmail.com>
Date: 9/5/68, 01:56
To: sylvia.hao@areal.com.au

Hi Sylvia,

It's been over a week since the plumber attended, and I've yet to see any update or progress on the condition of my unit. I had already sent photos clearly showing wall damage — fixing the leak alone doesn't resolve everything.

This unit is carpeted, and the leak went on for days. It's only logical to assume the carpet and underlay have been affected too. Does it really make sense to think the issue ends with the hot water pipe?

Also, why has there been complete silence? It's not even during a public holiday period this time, and yet I'm still left waiting with no information. Is the delay coming from the building manager, or is the owner just not interested in maintaining their own property?

I've been patient long enough. Please advise what steps are being taken regarding both the wall and the carpet, and whether an inspection will be arranged.

Regards,
Chawakorn

Date: 6/6/68, 01:21
To: "Sylvia Hao - Areal Property Hawthorn (MPM)" <mpm@email.propertyme.com>

Dear Sylvia,

I am writing with the intent of resolving this matter constructively and without escalation, if possible.

Over the past two months, I have reported the water damage issue multiple times in good faith, cooperated with your office, and done my best to remain in the property despite the difficulties. I am not trying to be confrontational; I simply need a clear and reasonable outcome, supported by appropriate action and communication.

Please find attached:

1. A formal demand letter outlining my request for rent compensation, a firm repair timeline, and confirmation of non-liability – based on my rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (VIC).

2. A supporting tenant statement summarising the verbal communication with your office around 2–3 June 2025, including the temporary accommodation proposal and its impractical conditions.

If a fair and written resolution is not reached within five (5) business days, I will have no choice but to initiate proceedings through VCAT. I sincerely hope this can be avoided and that we can achieve a reasonable solution for all parties involved.

I would appreciate your written response at your earliest convenience.

Dear Chawakorn,

You have recently been issued a notice to vacate by the property owner, with a required move-out date of 14/07/2025.

To facilitate a smooth and efficient vacating process, we kindly ask you to carefully review and follow the instructions provided below.

Final Payments:
Your rental status is currently paid to the 22/07/2025 with $0.00 on account.
A payment of $0.00 is due and payable prior to you vacating the property for the period up to the 14/07/2025.

Where to return keys: Please return keys & a copy of any cleaning receipts to our office at 33 Camberwell Road, Hawthorn East Vic 3123 between office hours. We are open Monday to Friday between 8.30am – 5.30pm during office hours. Please note, that if keys are not returned on or before the vacate date, rent will continue to be charged at the daily rate.

Power Connection: We recommend keeping the power connected for three business days after you return your keys. This will allow the final inspection to be completed with the power on. If the power is disconnected, we will need to establish a new connection, which may delay the bond return.

Final Inspection: We will conduct a final inspection of the property within 3 business days of the keys being returned. You are invited to attend the final inspection. If you would like to attend, please let me know ASAP so I can arrange a suitable time with you.

Bond Return: To ensure a speedy return of your bond, please return the property in its original condition, less normal wear and tear. You can expect your bond to be returned within 10 business days. For clarity on property expectations and to expedite the bond return process, please refer to the attached "Move out guide & tips to get your bond back."

Utility Cancelation: Ensure that you contact all your utility providers to advise your intended vacate date. Any bills or charges incurred after your vacate date will be your responsibility.

Cleaning: We kindly ask that you leave the property in a clean and tidy state, as outlined in the rental agreement & as per the in-going condition report. To assist with the cleaning process, we have attached the document labelled "Vacate cleaning guide'' to help you or your preferred cleaner.

Keys and Property Access: Please ensure that all keys, remotes, and other access devices provided to you are returned to the office and signed back in by your vacate date. Any unreturned or lost items will need to be replaced at your expense. Do not leave keys in the letterbox due to the risk of theft. Renters are responsible for replacing locks and keys if they are stolen from the letterbox. 

If you have any questions or need clarification on any of the above points, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Warm regards,
