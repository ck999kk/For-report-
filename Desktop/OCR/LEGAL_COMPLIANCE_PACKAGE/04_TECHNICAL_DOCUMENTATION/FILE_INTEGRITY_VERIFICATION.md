## INTEGRITY MONITORING

### Change Detection Protocol
1. **Baseline Established:** 16 August 2025 hashes serve as integrity baseline
2. **Verification Frequency:** Before each transfer or submission
3. **Alert Conditions:** Any hash mismatch indicates file modification
4. **Response Procedure:** Investigate cause and document any changes

### Expected Hash Stability
These files should maintain identical hash values throughout the legal process unless:
- Authorized modifications are made with proper documentation
- Files are reformatted for specific submission requirements
- Technical corrections are applied with chain of custody documentation

### Tamper Evidence
Any change to file content will result in completely different SHA256 hash values, providing cryptographic evidence of:
- Unauthorized modifications
- File corruption
- System integrity issues
- Transfer errors

---

## LEGAL COMPLIANCE NOTES

### Evidence Act 2008 (Victoria) Requirements
- **Section 48:** Hash verification supports document content proof
- **Authentication:** Cryptographic hashes provide technical authentication
- **Integrity:** Demonstrates files unchanged since creation
- **Chain of Custody:** Hash verification at each custody transfer

### VCAT Submission Standards
- **Technical Integrity:** Files verified for corruption-free submission
- **Size Compliance:** Total package (12.6MB) well under VCAT limits
- **Format Verification:** All files in acceptable formats
- **Accessibility:** Hash verification ensures file readability

### Digital Forensics Standards
- **NIST Guidelines:** Hash verification follows NIST SP 800-86 recommendations
- **ISO 27037:** Aligns with international digital evidence handling standards
- **Chain of Custody:** Cryptographic verification supports custody integrity
- **Expert Testimony:** Hash values provide technical foundation for expert evidence

### Technical Assurance
The cryptographic hash verification provides technical assurance that:
1. Files have not been altered since creation
2. No corruption has occurred during storage
3. Transfer integrity can be verified
4. Unauthorized access would be detectable
