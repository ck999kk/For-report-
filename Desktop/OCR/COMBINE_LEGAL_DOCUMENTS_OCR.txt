Description: challenging validity of notice to vacate - residential

Compensation amount claimed: $0

More details about the claim are:
This application challenges the validity of a Notice to Vacate dated 11 July 2025 issued by Areal Property Hawthorn. The notice constitutes retaliatory eviction under Section 91ZZE of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (Vic), issued in direct response to legitimate maintenance complaints regarding water damage in the bedroom wall reported on 16 April 2025.

Timeline evidence shows the landlord's pattern of hostility following our VCAT application RT252398 (lodged 24 June 2025, withdrawn 27 June 2025), with the retaliatory notice issued just 14 days after case withdrawal.

We seek orders declaring the notice invalid and preventing eviction based on retaliatory conduct.

NOTICE TO VACATE TO RENTER OF RENTED PREMISES
INFORMATION FOR RENTERS

Residential Tenancies Act 1997
Section 91ZZO(a)
(Regulation 37)

1. This is a notice to vacate. It tells you that the residential rental provider (rental provider) wants you to move out by a certain date. You can find details of this date in clause 10 "Termination date" below.

2. Challenging this notice - You may be able to challenge this Notice at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). Reasons to challenge a notice include:
• you believe you were given this notice due to unlawful discrimination or because you tried to exercise your rights as a renter; or
• you believe it was not given to you properly; or
• you disagree with the reason given or the information in the form is incorrect or incomplete; or
• you have experienced family or personal violence and this caused the behavior listed in the notice to vacate. In this case, you should apply to VCAT within 30 days after the notice has been given.

Specific timeframes may apply to certain reasons to challenge a notice. You may also challenge the validity of the notice if the rental provider applies to VCAT for a possession order.

You should seek advice if you are considering challenging a notice to vacate.

3. Unpaid Rent
If you received a notice because you have not paid your rent -
• If you pay all of the unpaid rent on or before the termination date in the notice, this notice has no effect.
• However, this does not apply if you have been given four earlier notices to vacate for rent arrears within a twelve-month period that starts either on the date your agreement commenced or the anniversary of that date.
• You can find out more about this type of notice to vacate on the Consumer Affairs Victoria website.

4. Possession orders and warrants - Rental providers must give you the appropriate notice to vacate before they apply to VCAT for a possession order.

If you do not vacate on the date stated in the notice, the rental provider may apply to VCAT asking for an order requiring you to leave (a possession order). VCAT will notify you of a hearing date that you can attend. You are encouraged to attend the hearing.

At the hearing, VCAT decides whether the rental provider was entitled to give you a notice to vacate. VCAT will make a possession order if it is satisfied that it is reasonable and proportionate to do so. VCAT may consider whether the notice to vacate was given in response to the act of a person who has subjected you to family or personal violence. It may also consider whether you can comply with a payment plan for any rental arrears, if applicable.

VCAT will decide if you must leave the property and on what date that should occur. You may ask for more time in the property if you will be in hardship. Rental providers cannot personally use force to remove you if you refuse to leave the property. Only Victoria Police can carry out a forcible eviction, and only when they are acting on a VCAT order (a warrant for possession).

5. Ending the residential rental agreement earlier - In some cases, you may be able to end the residential rental agreement (rental agreement) earlier than the termination date in the notice to vacate, if the notice is given for one of the following reasons:

Repairs or renovations; demolition; change of use of premises; occupation by the rental provider or their family; the premises are to be sold; the premises are required for a public purpose; the renter no longer meets the eligibility criteria; or in the case of a fixed term rental agreement, to specify a termination date that is on or after the date of the end of the initial fixed term of the agreement.

To notify the rental provider, use a Notice of intention to vacate form and provide at least 14 days notice.

6. Seeking advice - If you think you have grounds to challenge a notice to vacate at VCAT you should seek advice immediately by contacting one of the community legal organisations listed on the Consumer Affairs Victoria website. For further information visit the renting section of the Consumer Affairs Victoria website at consumer.vic.gov.au/renting or call 1300 558 181.

Email address: info-mpm@areal.com.au

10. Termination Date
The termination date must allow for:
• the minimum notice required under the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (the Act); and
• the proposed method of delivery and the date the renter is expected to receive the notice.

The minimum number of days' notice required under the Act is 0.

I request that you vacate on or before the following termination date: 14 July 2025

Note: If you want to challenge this notice you should seek legal advice as soon as possible.

11. Reason for notice
• The rental provider must select the relevant reason, section number and the minimum notice required under the act.
• The rental provider must also explain why the notice has been given. It is not enough to quote just from the Act or from the reasons on the information sheet; this must be accompanied by specific details.
• VCAT may find a notice to vacate invalid where it does not provide enough details or is not accompanied by the required documentary evidence.

I am giving you this notice for the following reason:

Section 91ZL Unsafe premises

The premises are unfit for human habitation or have been destroyed totally, or to such an extent as to be rendered unsafe.

A roof leak from common property caused water to enter the bedroom, resulting in swollen plaster, bubbling paint, and visible mould. On 23 May 2025, contractor FIXD Trade Group inspected and confirmed the room is unsafe. Urgent mould remediation is required, including sealing the room, chemical treatment, and drying using industrial equipment. Drying is expected to take 7 days, followed by reinstatement of plaster and painting, with the full process taking up to 14 days.

The property will be unsafe and unsuitable to occupy during this time due to noise, equipment use, and health risks. Despite multiple written requests, the renter has refused access, preventing critical repairs.

This Notice to Vacate is issued to allow urgent works and restore the property to a habitable standard. The renter is required to vacate by 14 July 2025.

In many cases this notice must be accompanied by documentary evidence. For information on documentary evidence go to www.consumer.vic.gov.au/ntv

Is documentary evidence attached? Yes

Please provide details of the evidence attached:
Message Thread Franklin Street (PDF)

This includes a detailed email thread between the managing agent, contractor (FIXD Trade Group), and the Owners Corporation. It provides:
- Confirmation of mould presence and safety concerns
- Scope of remediation works (drying, sealing, chemical treatment)
- Estimated timeline for drying (7 days) plus reinstatement
- Statement that the property is unsafe and inaccessible during the works
- Contractor recommendation for the tenant to vacate

12. Delivery of this notice
• The notice period begins the day after the renter is estimated to receive this notice.
• If sending by post, the rental provider must allow for the delivery time in calculating the proposed termination date.
• If sending by registered post, the rental provider should keep evidence of the mail delivery method used to send this notice.

This notice was sent on 11 July 2025

This notice will be delivered by email (if consent has been provided by the renter)

Renter's email address: bewty980219@gmail.com, ck.chawakorn@gmail.com

RENTED PREMISES: 243 Franklin St Unit1803, MELBOURNE 3000

BOND NUMBER(S): 15733722

Application under Residential Tenancies Act 1997 challenging validity of notice to vacate - residential Section 91ZZS

VCAT finds:
1. The applicants have filed an application under section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 challenging the validity of a notice to vacate.

2. The notice to vacate in question was given to the renter under section 91ZL of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997.

3. Section 91ZZS of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 specifies that a renter may apply to challenge the validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZX, 91ZY, 91ZZ, 91ZZA, 91ZZB or 91ZZC. It does not allow a renter to challenge the validity of a notice to vacate given under section 91ZL.

4. Pursuant to section 75 of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 1998, the Tribunal has formed the view on the material before it, that the application is misconceived.

5. The renters cannot preemptively challenge the notice to vacate. However, the renters can still challenge the validity of the notice to vacate under section 91ZZI of the Act if the residential rental provider applies for a possession order on the basis of the 91ZL notice to vacate issued on 11 July 2025.

6. The Tribunal notes that if the parties can agree on an arrangement for the renters to move out for about 14 days, the repairs could be completed and the renters could return to the premises.

VCAT orders:
1. The application is struck out with a right to apply for reinstatement.

Note: If the applicants apply for reinstatement they must provide details of why the strike out order is opposed, including a response to the findings made by the Tribunal above.

Application under Residential Tenancies Act 1997 possession - unfit or unsafe Section 322(1),91ZL

These directions provide IMPORTANT information about your hearing. You should follow the directions and make sure that all evidence relied on is sent to both VCAT and the other party at least 3 days before the hearing.

What is the application about?
1. The rental provider wants possession of the rented premises after giving the renter a notice to vacate under section 91ZL (Condition of premises) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 (the Act). Such a notice can be given if: the premises (a) are unfit for human habitation; or (b) have been destroyed totally or to such an extent as to be rendered unsafe.

Check whether the Notice to Vacate is valid
2. A notice to vacate is only valid if:
(a) it is in the prescribed form (Form 6, Schedule 1 of the Residential Tenancies Regulations 2021);
(b) it correctly identifies the rental provider, the renter and the address of the rented premises;
(c) it includes a reference to section 91ZL of the Act, being the grounds to give the notice;
(d) it contains sufficient detail about the condition of the premises and how they are unfit, destroyed or so unsafe as to be unhabitable, to put the renter on notice of the reason(s) why the notice has been given (it is not enough to repeat the words in the Act);
(e) it includes a date that the renter needs to leave (termination date); and
(f) it gives the renter enough notice to leave. Under section 91ZL, the termination date can be the same day the renter is given the notice.

NOTE: A possession order cannot be made if the notice to vacate is not valid. The rental provider should check the notice and, if it is not valid, immediately withdraw the application so that any hearing can be cancelled and the time reallocated.

What will VCAT consider at the hearing?
3. VCAT must determine or consider:
(a) the validity of the notice to vacate;
(b) whether the grounds to give the notice have been proved;
(c) whether it is reasonable and proportionate to make a possession order taking into account the interests of, and the impact of a possession order on, the rental provider, the renter and other residents or neighbours and the matters set out in section 330A of the Act.

What must the Rental Provider do?
4. The rental provider must send the following as soon as possible, to both the renter and the Tribunal:
(a) A completed "Summary of proofs - possession of residential rental premises for reasons other than rental arrears" (available to download from the VCAT website);
(b) A signed copy of the Notice to Vacate and any attachments, together with proof of service of the notice to vacate and the VCAT application (if sent by email, provide a copy of the email with the attachments and the written agreement showing consent to electronic service);
(c) Any evidence of the matters relied on in the notice to vacate and notification of any witnesses who will attend to give evidence; and
(d) Any statement addressing the issues outlined at paragraph 3 above.

What must the Renter do?
5. To ensure the matter is ready for hearing, the renter should send the following, to both the rental provider and the Tribunal, as soon as possible:
(a) A brief statement responding to the allegations contained in the notice to vacate;
(b) Any evidence that they want to rely on at the hearing and notification of any witnesses who will attend to give evidence; and
(c) Any statement addressing the issues outlined at paragraph 3 above.

How do I prepare and give my evidence to the other party?
6. Prepare your evidence and send it to the other party, in the following manner:
(i) Save each of your documents using a file name that enables the document to be readily identified by others, for example "s91ZM NTV No 3", "Ingoing condition report", "Video of incident 2.10.24", "Photo damage kitchen bench".
(ii) Note that any photograph should be in colour, and must identify the date taken, and the room / area of the premises to which the photograph relates.
(iii) Send a copy of your document to the other party, preferably to their last known email address, but otherwise to their last known postal address. Note you will need to provide proof of service to VCAT.
(iv) Do not use drop box links or zip files when sending your documents to the party.

How do I submit my evidence to VCAT for the hearing?
7. Submit your evidence for your hearing to VCAT in the following manner:

11. If you think more time is needed, you must immediately tell VCAT and explain why additional time is required. Any such request will be considered by a Head of List or Duty Member.

NOTE: Reasonable and Proportionate Considerations (ss330(1)(f) and 330A of the Act)

A. A possession order must be made if, in the circumstances of the particular application, it is reasonable and proportionate, having regard to section 330A, to make a possession order taking into account the interests of, and the impact on, each of the following (as relevant) in making the possession order-
(i) the rental provider
(ii) the renter
(iii) any person who has been affected by the acts or behaviour of the renter.

B. For the purposes of determining whether it is reasonable and proportionate to make a possession order, the Tribunal must have regard to the following:
(a) the nature, frequency and duration of the conduct of the renter which led to the notice to vacate being given, including whether the conduct is a recurring breach of obligations under a residential rental agreement;
(b) whether the breach is trivial;
(c) whether the breach was caused by the conduct of any person other than the renter;
(d) whether the renter has made an application for a family violence safety notice, family violence intervention order, non-local DVO or personal safety intervention order and-
(i) if an application has been made, whether a family violence safety notice, family violence intervention order, recognised non-local DVO or personal safety intervention order has been made and whether the notice or order is still in force; and
(ii) if a notice or order was made, whether it included an exclusion condition; and
(iii) any other matter in relation to family violence or personal violence the Tribunal considers relevant;
(e) whether the breach has been remedied as far as practicable;
(f) whether the renter has, or will soon have, capacity to remedy the breach and comply with any obligations under the residential rental agreement, as the case requires;
(g) the effect of the conduct of the renter on others as a renter;
(ga) any community statement provided by Homes Victoria;
(h) whether any other order or course of action is reasonably available instead of making a possession order;
(i) as the case requires, the behaviour of the residential rental provider, the provider's agent, and;
(j) any other matter the Tribunal considers relevant.
